# NuGet Dependency Tree

This npm package reads the NuGet dependencies of a .NET project, and generates a dependency tree.
This package was developed by JFrog, and is used by the [JFrog VS-Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JFrog.jfrog-vscode-extension) to generate the dependency tree for projects using NuGet dependencies.
You may use this package for other purposes and applications as well, either by running via command line or by importing to your project.

## Installation
`npm install -g nuget-deps-tree`

## Usage
### Prerequisites
